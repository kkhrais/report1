             <p>The influence of mood (IV) on creativity (DV) was investigated in this study. One hundred forty-three students studying psychology and related courses at University were asked to participate in the research. That took place during hours of usual seminars. Most of the participants that constituted a sample were at the age of their 20s, and the majority were female. Quasi- experiment was used to conduct the study. The results were obtained by asking the participants to do the PANAS mood questionnaire at first and Creativity Test consisted of six abstract figures. I was found that mood and creativity are to some extent related, however, the relationship is not significant as significance is more than p ≤ 0.05 (p = .116). Despite that, it can be confirmed that the results showed that mood and creativity are related in a positive direction.

            <h2 id="Intro" class="intro">Introduction/ Literature review</h2>
            <p>There is quite a lot of research about how levels of creativity change accordingly to one’s mood. What does creativity mean for a human’s psychology? One of the most meaningful definitions was elaborated by Vernon, who defined it as ‘a person’s capacity to produce new or original ideas, insights, restructurings, inventions, or artistic objects, which are accepted by experts as being of scientific, aesthetic, social, or technological value’. (Wyse & Dowson, 2009) The influence of mood on one’s creativity was examined by Diane Montgomery, Pamela A. Hodges and Judith S. Kaufman (2004), who stated there was some suggestion in the research they did that positive mood was associated to creative self-perception. Tomas Chamorro- Premuzic, who is a psychology professor at University College London, has written in one of his articles that it was proven a meditation and relaxation exercise can highly brighten our creativity as they warm the cockles of one’s heart. This way, it can be clearly understood that the better our mood is, the higher is our level of creativity. (Chamorro-Premuzic, 2020) In another study, R. Hirt, E. Devers and M. McCrea (2008) investigated that happy individuals were also much more prone to weight potential for creativeness in their task choice. Happy individuals to achieve their mood management goals, look forward to tasks that give them a possibility to be creative. This happens since being creative makes one feel good, so people choose creative activities to keep their positive mood up. Also, many of the researchers (e.g. Benjafield, 1996; Hirt, 1999; Hirt, McDonald and Melton, 1996; Isen and Baron, 1991, etc.) came to a general conclusion about the relationship between mood and creativity level which says that positive mood facilitates creative problem-solving. (Shavinina, 2003) Another research got the results that individuals who said they experience extreme or intense feelings or emotions on a daily basis had higher scores after being tested for creative capacity than people who simply said they are in a positive or negative mood. (Ceci & Kumar, 2015) Researchers of this study claim that “There’s something about living life with passion and intensity, including the full depth of human experience, that is conducive to creativity.” (Kaufman, 2015) Barbara Fredrickson states in her article that positive emotions are beneficial to creativeness because they broaden the intellect, while negative emotions are damaging to creativity because they narrow one’s focus. (Fredrickson, 2001) Teresa Amabile, who is an American psychologist and a professor at Harvard Business School as well as researcher, asked 240 people working in different industries to record emotions they felt on a particular day. The research showed that imaginativeness is positively related to pleasure and love and negatively connected with temper, worry, and anxiety. It was also proven that people feel the happiest when they come up with a creative idea, but it is more probable to happen if they felt happy the day before. It is about making a cognitive correlation that incubates during the night and shows up as an innovative thought the next day. (Naiman, 2018) Although, the research that has been done by Eddie Harmon-Jones and his colleagues put forward a hypothesis that crucial variable that has an impact on person’s scope of attention is not emotional valence (positive vs. negative emotions) but motivational intensity, or how powerfully you feel enforced to either move towards or stay away from something. For instance, pleasantness is a positive feeling, however, it has low motivational intensity. On the contrary, desire is a positive sensation with high motivational intensity. It was concluded that motivational intensity was a more important factor that affects the scope of attention in people than the bare coming into contact with positive or negative feelings, because of low motivational states smooth the progress of the search for new goals to pursue, while high motivational states centre us on completing a specific goal. (Harmon-Jones, Gable & Price, 2013) What is interesting, experiencing peak experiences in life, from the traumatic ones to the most joyful, may direct to flexibility and creativity on condition that it “diversifies your experiences and pushes you outside your normal thought patterns”.

                 <p>One hundred forty- three male and female students studying psychology and psychology-related courses at the Buckinghamshire New University in High Wycombe campus were recruited to participate in the study using an opportunity sampling method which involved asking students who were present at seminars at the time to take part in the research. All in all, 140 participants took part in the research as three of them (who identified themselves as females) were missing on that particular day thus failed to do the tests. Of all the participants that were present, 108 were female (M age: 20.7, SD: 4.33), 30 were male (M age: 21.47, SD: 5.11) and two other (M age: 18.5, SD: 0.7)

                <p>The participants were given the PANAS mood questionnaire and Creativity test to do during regular seminars time. The first one that students were supposed to do was the mood questionnaire scale, which consists of a set of 20 words that describe feelings and emotions. Using a scale from one to five, where one meant ‘very slightly or not at all’ and five- ‘extremely’, participants were told to specify the level to which they feel right now, at the moment of doing a test. 
                    After PANAS, participants did a creativity test. Each of 140 people that took part in the research was given six abstract figures and using one’s own imagination and creativity must have said what they represented. Their choices were rated on a scale from 1 (not creative at all) to 10 (extremely creative). Both PANAS mood questionnaire and creativity tests were done by students in a certain amount of time given by a lecturer.

                <p>Experimenters who did the research used quasi-experiment as they had no control over how they allocated subjects to groups. Hypothetically, it was possible to slightly influence participants’ mood, however, it was not done. 
                    The experiment took place in one of the rooms at the university and, as was said before, experimenters could try to manipulate the IV and measure changes in DV, which qualifies research as a field experiment. 
                    The independent variable was for that reason students’ (participants’) mood at the moment of doing research, and the dependent variable was their level of creativity.

                 <p>Participants took part in the research individually in a small seminar room on the Bucks New University campus. Before they did the tests, students were told that taking part is voluntary and assured that all the data they would provide are both anonymous and confidential. The researcher gave all the instructions needed to participate in the study. A projector was used to show them the task and the figures for the Creativity Test. After explaining the instructions, the participants were given PANAS questionnaire. The time to do it was not strictly limited. After that, they were given ten minutes to do the creativity test. However, the researcher controlled the time which was given for each figure by changing the slides. In the end, there were thanked for the participation in the study and given further instructions about collected data. Each of them was told to put their results separately in the SPSS on the researcher’s computer. In the last part, they were allowed to ask questions.

             <h2 id="Results" class="Results">Results</h2>
             <p>A Spearman’s rho was conducted to explore whether the mood is related to creativity or not. According to Cohen’s criteria, the level of correlation coefficient at 0.116 between the PANAS and Creativity Test, means a small effect size in the direction of a positive relationship. Also, the significance at 0.085 is non-significant, which can be interpreted that the results could be obtained by chance.</p>

             <p>However, these findings support stated at the beginning hypothesis as there is a slight positive correlation between mood and creativity.</p>

             <h2 id="Discussion" class="Discussion">Discussion</h2>
             <p>The aim of this study was to explore whether how a person feels thusly what our mood is like one particular day can have any impact on the level of creativity. This research showed that creativity is, indeed, affected by the mood. Data collected presents that positive mood and attitude can slightly influence positively the level of creativity. It has supported the hypothesis given at the beginning. The results that have been done in need of this study, are similar to the ones that researchers, whose studies were quoted in the introduction section, obtained in theirs. On the other hand, there can be found studies that reject my hypothesis and prove that, for instance, experiencing negative emotions enhance the process of creative thinking e.g. George & Zhou (2002). They ‘‘hypothesized and found that negative moods were positively related to creative performance when perceived recognition and rewards for creative performance and clarity of feelings (a meta mood process) were high’’. 
                Nevertheless, the results of this study cannot be found reliable. First of all, there was a relatively small group of people who participated in the study- only 143 people. Secondly,  the proportions between the number of male and female participants are not even close to equal, which can also matter as women have the tendency to be more moody and emotional, also quite often take actions and think under these emotions. Because of that, I would be minded to claim that it could influence their creativity level. Improvement could be made by reducing the difference between genders of participants- more males could take part in the study as reducing the number of females would reduce number of participants which is already quite small. Also, students who took part in the research were from a limited area (University) and all of them were studying a similar subject, which potentially can be connected with their personalities and interests. Then, personality influences the way people perceive reality, so it has an impact on creativeness as well. For example, the researchers should ask students from different fields of study to do PANAS scale and Creativity Test. Participants were also at a similar age and that make the researchers unable to make a generalisation of the results to the bigger population.
                Accordingly to this particular research, people have a small tendency to be less creative when they are sad. Although, one’s mood can be manipulated, so that can influence the level of creativity for better. For instance, it can be applied in the work environment, for instance, in the marketing department in some corporations. When a team of employees feels lack of motivation because of their bad mood, the manager can give them some positive feedback about what they did before to remember them they are good workers or let them watch some videos, listen to music, which would probably make them feel better and give them motivation back, so they can improve effectiveness in tasks that require imagination and creative thinking. What can enhance one’s creativity is also doing what that person likes to do. If someone is interested in the field that is involved in, or passionate about it, that individual has a bigger motivation and is more creative than when it is about something one is not interested in at all. It is associated with being happy about what you do.
                It is concluded that the creativity is affected by the mood and attitude. Positive mood and emotions a person experiences at the time, are good facilitators for the bigger intensity of creativity. Even if a person is in a negative mood and it is not favourable for both creative thinking and problem solving, judgement of the situation as well, it can be manipulated and changed to positive by doing things that are pleasant and desired by that person. It can be done by watching something funny e.g. video to stimulate someone to laugh. This may have implications for corporation environment or any other work environment and ideas that employees have to come up with, for instance, to release new product to the market.
